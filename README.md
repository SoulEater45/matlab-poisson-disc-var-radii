# Matlab Poisson Disc Var Radii
Matlab implementation of the Poisson Disc sampling using different/varying radii sizes.

Parameters for the script:
- dimension - size of each dimension to be fittet in
- radii - array of possible radii to be used (sampled uniformly for now)
- k - number of attempts to fit new point for an active point
- o - additional varying offset between the points
- vis - visualise generating the circles (only works in 2 and 3 dimensions)
